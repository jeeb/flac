NOTE: files metadata_utils.c and metadata_utils.h are copied from
the ../test_libFLAC directory.  It's too much pain to make a
convenience library for these and CVS can't do soft links, so
we put up with having two copies of these sources.

file_utils.c and file_utils.h are also copies, with trivial
changes, for use in this package.
