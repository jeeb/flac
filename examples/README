Here are several small example programs that use the libraries in different
ways.

The "c" directory has programs that are all in C and use libFLAC.

The "cpp" directory has analogous programs that are all in C++ and use libFLAC++. 

The programs are:
c/decode/file/ - example_c_decode_file - Simple FLAC file decoder using libFLAC
