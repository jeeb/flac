FLAC (http://flac.sourceforge.net/) is an Open Source lossless audio
codec developed by Josh Coalson.

FLAC is comprised of 1) `libFLAC', a library which implements
reference encoders and decoders, licensed under the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL); 2) `flac', a command-line program for
encoding and decoding files, licensed under the GNU General public
License (GPL); 3) `metaflac', a command-line program for editing
FLAC metadata, licensed under the GPL; 4) player plugins for XMMS
and Winamp, licensed under the GPL; and 5) documentation, licensed
under the GNU Free Documentation License.

==========
FLAC - 1.0
==========

This is the source release for the FLAC project.  See

	doc/index.html

for full documentation.

A brief description of the directory tree:

	doc/       the HTML documentation
	include/   public include files for libFLAC
	src/       the source code and private headers
	test/      the test scripts


=============================
Building in a GNU environment
=============================

FLAC now uses autoconf and libtool for configuring and
building.  Better documentation for these will be
forthcoming, but in general, this should work:

./configure ; make ; make install

To disable all assembly optimizations, pass the
--disable-asm-optimizations flag to configure.


==================
Building with MSVC
==================

There is no overall make system for MSVC but the individual
source directories with a 'Makefile.vc' file in them allow
building with MSVC.  Just 'nmake /f Makefile.vc'.  Currently
the Makefile.vc for libFLAC is hardcoded to use nasm.  If
you don't have nasm, or don't want any assembly optimizations,
edit the makefile, adding '/D FLAC__NO_ASM' and delete the
rules which compile the .s files.
