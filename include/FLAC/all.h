 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * This is the documentation for the FLAC C and C++ APIs.  It is
 * highly interconnected; this introduction should give you a top
 * level idea of the structure and how to find the information you
 * need.  As a prerequisite you should have at least a basic
 * knowledge of the FLAC format, documented
 * <A HREF="../format.html">here</A>.
 *
 * \section c_api FLAC C API
 *
 * The FLAC C API is the interface to libFLAC, a set of structures
 * describing the components of FLAC streams, and functions for
 * encoding and decoding streams, as well as manipulating FLAC
 * metadata in files.  The public include files will be installed
 * in your include area as <include>/FLAC/...
 *
 * By writing a little code and linking against libFLAC, it is
 * relatively easy to add FLAC support to another program.  The
 * library is licensed under the
 * <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">LGPL</A>.
 * Complete source code of libFLAC as well as the command-line
 * encoder and plugins is available and is a useful source of
 * examples.
 *
 * libFLAC usually only requires the standard C library and C math
 * library. In particular, threading is not used so there is no
 * dependency on a thread library. However, libFLAC does not use
 * global variables and should be thread-safe.
 *
 * \section cpp_api FLAC C API
 *
 * The FLAC C++ API is a set of classes that encapsulate the
 * structures and functions in libFLAC.  They provide slightly more
 * functionality with respect to metadata but are otherwise
 * equivalent.  For the most part, they share the same usage as
 * their counterparts in libFLAC, and the FLAC C API documentation
 * can be used as a supplement.  The public include files
 * for the C++ API will be installed in your include area as
 * <include>/FLAC++/...
 *
 * libFLAC++ is also licensed under the
 * <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">LGPL</A>.
 *
 * \section getting_started Getting Started
 *
 * A good starting point for learning the API is to browse through
 * the <A HREF="modules.html">modules</A>.  Modules are logical 
 * groupings of related functions or classes, which correspond roughly
 * to header files or sections of header files.  Each module includes a
 * detailed description of the general usage of its functions or
 * classes.
 *
 * From there you can go on to look at the documentation of
 * individual functions.  You can see different views of the individual
 * functions through the links in top bar across this page.
